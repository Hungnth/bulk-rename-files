# Bulk Rename Files
To use the script, simply enter the substring to be replaced and the replacement string when prompted. The script will then walk through the current directory and its subdirectories, replacing the specified substring in each file name and renaming the file if necessary.

Keep in mind that it is always a good idea to make backups before renaming files, as this process cannot be undone. Use this script at your own risk.
