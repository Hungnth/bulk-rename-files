# Bulk Rename Tool

This script allows you to easily rename files in the current directory and its subdirectories by replacing a given substring with another given string. If no replacement string is provided, the substring will simply be removed from the file names.

## How to Use

To use the script, simply enter the substring to be replaced and the replacement string when prompted. The script will then walk through the current directory and its subdirectories, replacing the specified substring in each file name and renaming the file if necessary.

Keep in mind that it is always a good idea to make backups before renaming files, as this process cannot be undone. Use this script at your own risk.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory where the script is located in the terminal, and then type:

python3 rename_files.py


This will execute the script and prompt you to enter the substring and replacement string.
